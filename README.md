# Mobarena

A little Minecraft plugin used for setting up and participating in fights against mobs organized in waves.
This plugin was in use for the SoulUnity Minecraft server during its uptime.

# YML examples

The plugin is fully configurable and all items, locations and enemy waves are saved in yml files.
The YMLExample folder gives a few examples of how these should be structured.
